Ensure that packages have been downloaded once and init them as needed.

This will not update the sources by using `apt-get install' or
`git pull', but it will ensure that:

* the packages have been installed
* load-path is set so their elisp files can be found
* Info-directory-list is set so their info files can be found
* Autoloads have been prepared and evaluated for each package
* Any post-installation setup (e.g. `(require 'feature)') happens

When SYNC is nil (the default), all installations run
concurrently, in the background.

When SYNC is 'sync, each package will be installed synchronously,
and any error will stop it all.

Please note that the `el-get-init' part of `el-get' is always
done synchronously. There's `byte-compile' support though, and
the packages you use are welcome to use `autoload' too.

PACKAGES is expected to be a list of packages you want to install
or init.  When PACKAGES is omited (the default), the list of
already installed packages is considered.

PACKAGE can be either a simple package name or a package name
with a modifier before the name to specify local recipe source
information:

* `<owner>/' : specifies a Github owner name
* `gist:<id>' : specifies a Gist ID
* `<type>:' : specifies a type of the package source

If `FEATURE in PACKAGE' form is used instead of PACKAGE, then
that FEATURE is `require'd after installing PACKAGE.  You can
also use `el-get-bundle!' macro if FEATURE and PACKAGE are the
same.  If you wish to `require' more than one feature, then use
`:features' property in FORM.

The initialization FORM may start with a property list that
describes a local recipe.  The FORM after the property list is
treated as initialization code, which is actually an `:after'
property of the local recipe.

A copy of the initialization code is stored in a directory
specified by `el-get-bundle-init-directory' and its byte-compiled
version is used if `el-get-bundle-byte-compile' is non-nil.

\(fn)" t nil)

(autoload 'jedi:install-server "jedi/jedi-core" "\
This command installs Jedi server script jediepcserver.py in a
Python environment dedicated to Emacs.  By default, the
environment is at ``~/.emacs.d/.python-environments/default/``.
This environment is automatically created by ``virtualenv`` if it
does not exist.

Run this command (i.e., type ``M-x jedi:install-server RET``)
whenever Jedi.el shows a message to do so.  It is a good idea to
run this every time after you update Jedi.el to sync version of
Python modules used by Jedi.el and Jedi.el itself.

You can modify the location of the environment by changing
`jedi:environment-root' and/or `python-environment-directory'.  More
specifically, Jedi.el will install Python modules under the directory
``PYTHON-ENVIRONMENT-DIRECTORY/JEDI:ENVIRONMENT-ROOT``.  Note that you
need command line program ``virtualenv``.  If you have the command in
an unusual location, use `python-environment-virtualenv' to specify the
location.

.. NOTE:: jediepcserver.py is installed in a virtual environment but it
   does not mean Jedi.el cannot recognize the modules in virtual
   environment you are using for your Python development.  Jedi
   EPC server recognize the virtualenv it is in (i.e., the
   environment variable ``VIRTUAL_ENV`` in your Emacs) and then
   add modules in that environment to its ``sys.path``.  You can
   also add ``--virtual-env PATH/TO/ENV`` to `jedi:server-args'
   to include modules of virtual environment even you launch
   Emacs outside of the virtual environment.

.. NOTE:: It is highly recommended to use this command to install
   Python modules for Jedi.el.  You still can install Python
   modules used by Jedi.el manually.  However, you are then
   responsible for keeping Jedi.el and Python modules compatible.
